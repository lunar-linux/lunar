# DEPENDS example
#

# always end the line with && except for the last one!

# single depends:
#	depends moduleA

# single optional depends:
#	optional_depends  "moduleA" "" "" "For blabla support"

# optional depends that use configure switches:
# optional_depends  "moduleC" \
#                       "--with-configure-option" \ 
#                       "--without-configure-option" \ 
#                       "for blabla support"

# multiple depends:
#	depends moduleA &&
#	depends moduleB

# or everything:
# depends  moduleA &&
# depends  moduleB &&
# optional_depends  "moduleC" \
#			"--with-configure-option" \
#			"--without-configure-option" \
#			"for blabla support" &&
# optional_depends  "moduleD" "" "" "For blabla support"

# follower dependencies (auto-accept/reject based on leader):
# When SDL is accepted, SDL_ttf, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer are also accepted.
# When SDL is rejected, all three followers are also rejected.
# optional_depends  "SDL" "--enable-sdl" "--disable-sdl" "for SDL support" &&
# optional_depends_requires SDL SDL_ttf SDL_image SDL_mixer

# mutually exclusive choice (pick one of several options):
# The user is asked for each module in order. Once one is chosen,
# the rest are automatically skipped.
# optional_depends_one_of "SSL provider" \
#                         openssl  "--with-openssl"  "--without-openssl" \
#                         gnutls   "--with-gnutls"   "--without-gnutls" \
#                         libressl "--with-libressl" "--without-libressl"
