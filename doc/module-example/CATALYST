# CATALYST example
#
# Format: <event> <watched_module> <action> [param] [immediate]
#
# Events:
#   on_install      - fires after the watched module is installed
#   on_pre_install  - fires before the watched module is installed
#   on_remove       - fires after the watched module is removed
#   on_pre_remove   - fires before the watched module is removed
#
# Actions:
#   lin      - rebuild this module
#   lrm      - remove this module
#   fix      - run integrity checks and repair this module
#   enable   - turn on an optional dependency (param = dep module)
#   disable  - turn off an optional dependency (param = dep module)
#   exec     - run a custom script from this module's directory (param = script name)
#
# The optional "immediate" keyword at the end of a rule causes the trigger
# to fire right after the watched module completes instead of being batched.
# Pre-events (on_pre_install, on_pre_remove) always fire immediately.
#
# Environment variables available during exec scripts:
#   CATALYST_MODULE         - the watched module that caused the trigger
#   CATALYST_MODULE_VERSION - its version
#

# Rebuild this module when openssl is installed (e.g. for linked library updates):
#	on_install openssl lin

# Immediate rebuild — fires right away instead of after all modules complete.
# Use this when later modules depend on this rebuild (e.g. openssl -> wget):
#	on_install openssl lin immediate

# Enable an optional dependency when a module becomes available, then rebuild:
#	on_install moduleA enable moduleA
#	on_install moduleA lin

# Disable the dependency when the module is removed, then rebuild:
#	on_remove moduleA disable moduleA
#	on_remove moduleA lin

# Cascade removal — remove this module when another is removed:
#	on_remove moduleB lrm

# Run a custom script (must be in this module's directory):
#	on_install linux exec rebuild-for-kernel.sh

# Run integrity checks after a dependency is updated:
#	on_install glibc fix
